# 🌙 Thermal & Night Vision with Python

A real-time computer vision project simulating thermal and night vision effects using OpenCV. Inspired by military tech and sci-fi surveillance — built to show how powerful simple image processing can be when wielded right.

## 🔥 What This Does

This project captures webcam footage and transforms it into two different visual modes:

- **🌘 Night Vision Mode** – Emulates green-tinted infrared camera view for dark environments.
- **🌡️ Thermal Vision Mode** – Applies color mapping to simulate heat-based imaging.

It’s plug-and-play. Fire it up, switch modes, and watch your laptop go full *Predator Vision*.
